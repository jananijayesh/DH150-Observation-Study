# DH150-Observation-Study
Step 1:

Specify the main design challenge: 

The main design challenge would be to navigate the different sections of the restaurant, figure out what cuisine is served at each restaurant, figure out the hours, and accordingly make a reservation for a date. 
The basic need that this activity would fulfill is a sense of social belonging. Going out to exclusive places like this with others fosters a sense of intimacy with whoever you are going with as you both are experiencing a novel and unique place together. It can also temporarily take away feelings of loneliness. This need is also traditionally satisfied through attending other social gatherings or spots, interactions on social media, or simply meeting people who are already part of your social circle. 


Step 2: 
Target users:

The target user is whoever is either resides in London or is planning to visit the city and is open to the idea of visiting Sketch. It can include people of any socioeconomic or demographic entity, as the restaurant is open to all. The users could complete the activity wherever they have access to a digital device, so that they can access the website. All they would have to do is play around with the website, explore the different sections for the different areas, read through the menus, figure out what they would like the most, check out the opening hours, and finally make a reservation for two. 


Step 3: 
Pick an observation method:

I will conduct the research through participatory observation. I kept asking questions and taking notes, but I didnâ€™t interfere in their search tasks.
